5</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>Of course there was a baby in the case&mdash;a baby and 
mongrel dog, and a little boy and girl.&nbsp; They baby was 
small, and not particularly fair, but it had round limbs and a 
dimple or two, and a soft, half-pathetic, half-doggy look in its 
blue eyes, and the usual knack, which most helpless little babies
have, of twining itself round the hearts of those who took care 
of it.</p>
<p>The caretakers of this baby were the two children and the 
dog.&nbsp; Of course <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>a woman, who went by the name of 
nurse, did duty somewhere in the background; she washed the baby 
and dressed it in the morning, and she undressed it at night, and
she prepared food for it; but the caretakers who called up smiles
to the little white face, who caused the baby to show that 
enticing little dimple which it had in one of its cheeks, who 
made that strange, sweet, half-pathetic, half-humorous look come 
into its eyes, were the children and the dog.&nbsp; The baby had 
a sad history; it had entered the world with sorrow.&nbsp; Its 
mother had died at its birth, and the little wee orphan creature 
had been brought away almost directly to an uncle&rsquo;s 
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must do it, wife,&rsquo; said Mr Franklin; 
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s poor John died two months back, and now 
there&rsquo;s his widow following him, poor creature, and no one 
to look <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>after that wee mite of a babe.&nbsp; 
We must have it here, it&rsquo;s our plain duty, and I 
don&rsquo;t suppose one extra mouth to feed can make much 
difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all you men know,&rsquo; replied Mrs 
Franklin, who was a very tall, thin, fretful-looking woman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No difference indeed!&nbsp; A baby make no 
difference!&nbsp; And who&rsquo;s to tend on the lodgers, and 
bring in the grist to the mill, if all my time, day and night, is
taken up minding the baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr Franklin.&nbsp; He was as 
peaceable as his wife was the reverse.&nbsp; He did not want the 
baby, but neither did he wish to send poor John&rsquo;s child to 
the workhouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must make the best of it, wife,&rsquo; he 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Martha&rsquo;ll help you, and I daresay Peter 
and Flossy will take a turn in looking after the young 
&rsquo;un.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin said no more; she went up-stairs, and got a 
certain disused attic <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>into some sort of order.&nbsp; The 
attic was far away from the rest of the house; it was the top 
story of a wing, which had been added on to the tall, ramshackle 
old house.&nbsp; In some of the rooms underneath, the Franklin 
family themselves slept; in others they lived, and in others they
cooked.&nbsp; The rest of the house, therefore, was free for the 
accommodation of lodgers.</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin earned the family bread by taking in 
lodgers.&nbsp; She was far more active than her husband, who had 
a very small clerkship in the city; without her aid the children,
Peter and Flossy, could scarcely have lived, but by dint of 
toiling from morning to night, of saving every penny, of turning 
and re-turning worn-out clothes, and scrubbing and cooking and 
brushing and cleaning, Mrs Franklin contrived to make two ends 
meet.&nbsp; Her lodgers said that the rooms they occupied were 
clean and neat, that their food was <!-- page 9--><a 
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>well cooked, 
and above all things that the house was quiet.&nbsp; Therefore 
they stayed on; year after year the same people lived in the 
parlours, and occupied the genteel drawing-room floor; and hard 
as her lot was, Mrs Franklin considered herself a lucky woman, 
and her neighbours often envied her.</p>
<p>The house where the Franklins lived was in one of those remote
old-world half-forgotten squares which are to be found at the 
back of Bloomsbury.&nbsp; In their day these squares had seen 
fashion and life, but the gay world had long, long ago passed 
them by and forgotten them, and in consequence, although the 
houses were large and commodious, the rents were low.</p>
<p>Things had gone fairly well with the Franklins since they took
the old house&mdash;that is, things had gone fairly well until 
the arrival of the baby&mdash;but, as Mrs Franklin said to her 
husband, no <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>baby could come into any house 
without making a sight of difference.&nbsp; She had only two 
servants to help her in all her heavy work, and how could either 
she or they devote much time to nursing and tending a little 
new-born child?</p>
<p>The baby, however, arrived.&nbsp; It was sent up at once to 
the nursery which was hastily prepared for it.&nbsp; Flossy, aged
six, and Peter, who was between eight and nine, followed it 
up-stairs, and watched it with profound and breathless interest, 
while Martha, the most trustworthy of the servants, undressed it,
and fed it, and put it to sleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect duck,&rsquo; said Flossy.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Look at its wee little face, and isn&rsquo;t its skin 
soft!&nbsp; Might we kiss it, Martha?&nbsp; Would it break it, or
anything, if we was to kiss it very soft and tender 
like?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t a doll, child,&rsquo; said Martha.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It won&rsquo;t break with you loving of it.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
11</span>Kiss it, Flossy&mdash;babes is meant for kissing 
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The children bent down, and printed a tender salute on the wee
baby&rsquo;s face, and that night they scarcely slept themselves 
for fear of disturbing it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll be allowed to take care of the wee 
baby,&rsquo; whispered Flossy to her brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
think we could do it werry nice; don&rsquo;t you, 
Peter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Peter.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be 
something to amuse us; it&rsquo;s rather dull, you know, always 
having to keep quiet on account of the lodgers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter and Flossy soon found they were to have their 
wish.&nbsp; Martha could only spare a very short time to 
attending to the baby&rsquo;s wants, and the poor little mite 
would have had a very unhappy and neglected life but for the 
children.</p>
<p>As it happened, however, the wee white baby had not a dull 
life of it at <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>all; when its teeth were not 
troubling it, and when it was not very hungry, it had quite a 
merry time.&nbsp; It was devoted to the children, and even when 
it was sending forth its wail for more food and some real 
mother&rsquo;s love, it would stop crying and give a clear hearty
little laugh if Flossy shook her head of tangled red-brown hair 
in front of it, or if Snip-snap, the mongrel terrier, stood on 
his hind-legs and begged to it.</p>
<p>Peter and Flossy had been rather troublesome children before 
the arrival of the baby.&nbsp; Mrs Franklin&rsquo;s lodgers were 
fond of calling them &lsquo;little termagants,&rsquo; and liked 
exceedingly to hint to the mother that if the termagants did not 
make themselves scarce they would be obliged to seek other 
quarters.&nbsp; Poor Mrs Franklin was always extremely frightened
when these things were said, for she knew the rent, and to a 
certain <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>extent the daily bread of the 
children, depended on the lodgers.&nbsp; When she learned that 
the baby must inevitably come to them, she laid one very solemn 
command upon her household.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On no account whatever let out to Mrs Sinclair, and Mrs
Potts, and Mr Martin that there is a baby in the house.&nbsp; If 
you do, go they will, and nothing that I can possibly say will 
keep them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m terribly frightened to think how the 
baby&rsquo;s existence can be kept from them, but if they know 
it, most certainly go they will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; said Flossy, who was rather afraid of 
her mother, and did not often put a direct question to her, 
&lsquo;if the baby stays up in the old, old attic-nursery, and if
Pete and me and Snip can play with it and it never cries, then 
Mrs Potts and Mr Martin needn&rsquo;t know nothing about it, need
they, mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
14</span>&lsquo;If it never cries, Flossy, they need not know 
about it,&rsquo; answered Mrs Franklin; &lsquo;but whoever yet 
heard of a baby not crying?&nbsp; Of course it will cry all day 
and all night.&nbsp; I know it will be the ruin of us, and I 
think it was very unkind of your father to allow it to be brought
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But suppose, mother, Pete and I play with the baby, and
we make it so happy that it doesn&rsquo;t cry?&rsquo; answered 
little Flossy.</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin gave a short sniff, and said in decidedly an 
unbelieving voice, &lsquo;You may try your best, my dear, of 
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Flossy looked at Peter, and Peter looked back at her, and
they called Snip-snap and went out of the room.</p>
<p>This was the way in which the baby became the children&rsquo;s
special care; she was immediately thrown upon their <!-- page 
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>tender mercies, they considered themselves answerable 
for her good behaviour, and Flossy almost wore herself out in 
devising amusements for her.&nbsp; She would toss all her hair 
over her face and dance wildly up and down, and contort that same
little, funny, freckled face into all sorts of grimaces; and when
the baby laughed and crowed, and made chirrupy sounds, she was 
abundantly satisfied.&nbsp; Peter, too, was most ingenious in 
keeping off the fatal sounds of baby&rsquo;s wailing: he would 
blow into a paper bag, and then when the baby had screwed up her 
face, and was preparing to let out a whole volley of direful 
notes, he would clap his hands violently on the bag and cause it 
to explode, thereby absolutely frightening the poor little 
creature into smiles.</p>
<p>Peter would sing all kinds of nursery rhymes for the baby, and
walk up and <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>down with it, and even run with it 
until his arms ached very badly indeed.&nbsp; But after all, the 
one who suffered most in the cause of the baby was 
Snip-snap.&nbsp; The patience with which he bore being dressed up
in all kinds of costumes, being made to represent grannie with 
her spectacles, and lame John with his crutch, and a soldier in 
full-dress uniform, and a sailor with a broken arm, and 
everything in the world, in short, except a spirited little dog 
with four legs, was truly wonderful.&nbsp; He never did attempt 
to bite, and he was only once guilty of barking; but during the 
grandmother exhibition he could not help throwing up his head and
giving a prolonged and unearthly howl.&nbsp; But the naughty baby
only laughed quite merrily over the howl, and the two children 
begged of Snip-snap to do it again.&nbsp; He never did howl any 
more&mdash;that was his last despairing protest&mdash;in <!-- 
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>future he submitted to the baby&rsquo;s caprices, but 
with the air of a broken-hearted dog.</p>
<p>Peter and Flossy had commenced their care of the baby without 
any special love for her, but of course they could not long hold 
her in their arms, and play with her, and think for her, and 
earnestly desire to win her smiles and banish her tears, without 
the usual thing happening.&nbsp; The baby stole their little 
hearts into her own safe keeping.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his 
sufferings she also stole Snip-snap&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; After 
that the baby was of course mistress of the situation.</p>
<p>The children took care of her by day, and the lodgers knew 
nothing about her existence; but at night Martha, the old nurse, 
went into her nursery and slept with her, and attended to her 
wants.&nbsp; Peter and Flossy having learned the mystery of 
amusing the small mite, were <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>tolerably 
happy about her during the daytime, but at night they were 
obliged to be parted from her, and in consequence at night they 
were full of fears.&nbsp; Martha meant to be kind, but she was 
tired, and she often slept soundly, and did not hear the baby 
when she awoke and demanded attention.</p>
<p>Flossy became quite a light sleeper herself, and would 
sometimes steal into the nursery and try to quiet the baby; so 
that, on the whole, for some time, even at night, the lodgers 
heard no sound of the new little inmate.&nbsp; But all happy and 
worthy things come to an end, and so, alas! did the baby&rsquo;s 
good behaviour.&nbsp; There came a night, about three months 
after her arrival, and when she was about six months old, when 
baby was very restless, cross, and fidgety, with the cutting of 
her first tooth.&nbsp; The children had quite worn themselves out
in <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
19</span>her cause in the daytime, and Snip-snap had allowed 
himself to be arrayed in all his costumes for her benefit; but 
Martha had come to bed as tired and weary as the baby herself, 
and in consequence she fell fast asleep, and never heard the 
little creature&rsquo;s cries.</p>
<p>Peter and Flossy heard them at the other side of the wall, and
knowing that they were much louder and more piercing than usual, 
they both got up and, hand-in-hand, went to the nursery 
door.&nbsp; Snip-snap also followed them, but unwillingly, and 
with his tail between his legs.&nbsp; The door on this 
unfortunate night was locked, and the children could not get 
in.&nbsp; Martha slept on, and the baby screamed on, and 
presently poor Peter and Flossy heard Mr Martin get up and ring 
his bell violently.&nbsp; Mrs Potts was also heard to open her 
room door and come out on the landing, and <!-- page 20--><a 
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>sniff in a 
very disagreeable way, and go back again.&nbsp; Flossy&rsquo;s 
heart quite beat with terror, and Peter said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Flossy; they&rsquo;ll all know about
our baby in the morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;ll they do?&rsquo; asked Flossy in an 
awe-struck voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; answered Peter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I daren&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; Something bad I 
&rsquo;spect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the two children crept back to their beds, and Flossy 
cried herself to sleep.</p>

<h2><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
21</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>&lsquo;You must answer me this question very decidedly, 
ma&rsquo;am: am I to go, or the baby?&nbsp; Is my night&rsquo;s 
sleep to be again disturbed by the peevish wails of a troublesome
infant?&nbsp; I must know at once, madam, what you intend to 
do?&nbsp; Miss Jenkins, over the way, has offered me her front 
parlour with the bedroom behind, and her terms are lower than 
yours.&nbsp; You have but to say the word, ma&rsquo;am, and my 
bed will be well aired, and the room at Miss Jenkins&rsquo;s all 
comfortable for me to-night.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want you to turn
that infant away, oh dear me! no, but I must decide my own plans;
stay in the house with <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>a baby, and have my sleep broken, I 
will not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was Mr Martin.&nbsp; He had come into Mrs 
Franklin&rsquo;s little back parlour and expressed his mind very 
freely.&nbsp; The poor woman was standing up and regarding her 
best lodger with a puzzled and almost despairing air.&nbsp; She 
did not know that Flossy had crept into the room and was hiding 
herself behind her chair, and that Flossy&rsquo;s little face had
grown even more white and despairing than her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me until to-night, sir,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Mrs Potts has also been in and complaining about the poor 
child.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s an orphan child, and my husband&rsquo;s 
niece, but we are in no way bound to support her.&nbsp; I would 
not treat her badly, sir, but there are limits; and, of course, 
as you say, your night&rsquo;s sleep must not be broken.&nbsp; 
Rather than that should <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>happen, Mr Martin, I would send the 
child to the workhouse, for, of course, she has no legal claim on
us.&nbsp; If you will be so kind, sir, as to give me until 
to-morrow morning, I will then let you know what I have decided 
to do with the baby, and I faithfully promise that you are not to
be disturbed to-night, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is all right,&rsquo; said Mr Martin, with a 
mollified air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course it is not to be expected 
that an old bachelor such as I am should be worried by an 
infant&rsquo;s screams.&nbsp; The screams of a baby have to me an
appalling sound.&nbsp; Do what you think well with the child, 
ma&rsquo;am, and let me know in the morning; only I may as well 
state that I think the workhouse an extreme measure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Mr Martin left the house.&nbsp; Mrs Franklin followed him
out of the room, and Flossy crept slowly back to the nursery.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>Mrs Franklin did not notice her little daughter, and 
Flossy did not venture to address her mother.&nbsp; She came into
the room where Peter and Snip-snap were doing their utmost for 
the baby.&nbsp; Peter had her in his arms, and was walking up and
down with her, and Snip-snap was bounding after a ball and 
tossing it into the air for her benefit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s to go, Peter,&rsquo; said Flossy.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I guessed it&mdash;I guessed it quite well last 
night.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s to go away to the 
workhouse&mdash;that&rsquo;s what mother said; I heard her 
telling Mr Martin so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s not!&rsquo; said Peter.&nbsp; He turned 
very pale, and, still holding the child in his arms, sat down on 
the nearest chair.</p>
<p>It is to be doubted whether this poor neglected baby had ever 
been christened.&nbsp; The children had given her a name of their
own; they had called her Dickory <!-- page 25--><a 
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Dock.&nbsp; 
The reason they had given her this distinctive title was because 
the first amusement which had brought a smile to her little face 
had been the old play of Dickory Dock and the mouse that ran up 
the clock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said it,&rsquo; repeated Flossy, coming up close to
her brother, and fixing her anxious eyes on the baby.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;She said that our Dickory was to go to the 
workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well then, she shan&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Peter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I know nothing about workhouses, but I expect they are 
very nasty places, and Dickory shan&rsquo;t go there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he sat silent, his arm round the little child, who looked
up at him and then back at Flossy, and then smiled in that 
wonderfully pathetic way she had.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, Flossy,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;if you are
quite certain sure that mother <!-- page 26--><a 
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>said the 
workhouse, that she didn&rsquo;t say nothing about Dickory Dock 
being put to sleep in another room, or maybe down in the 
kitchen&mdash;if you are quite positive about the workhouse, 
Flossy, why, I know what I&rsquo;ll do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did say the workhouse,&rsquo; answered Flossy; 
&lsquo;I heard her with my own ears, and Mr Martin said it was a 
stream measure.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what he meant by that, 
but I do know that mother said the workhouse, and that she has 
got till to-morrow morning to take baby away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Peter; 
&lsquo;we&rsquo;ll take her away first, you and me, 
Flossy&mdash;you and me and Snip-snap&mdash;we&rsquo;ll take our 
little baby away, and we&rsquo;ll hide her.&nbsp; Dickory shall 
never go to no workhouse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Dickory looked up again at Peter, who looked down at her 
and <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>kissed her, and two tears splashed from his eyes on her 
little face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what a dear baby she is!&rsquo; said Flossy.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Yes, Peter, we&rsquo;ll run away, and we&rsquo;ll take 
Dickory.&nbsp; Where shall we take her to, Peter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Peter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll get her out of this, that&rsquo;s the first 
thing.&nbsp; How much money have you got, Flossy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A crooked halfpenny,&rsquo; said Flossy, in a decided 
voice.</p>
<p>Peter sighed.&nbsp; He was older than Flossy, and he knew that
a crooked halfpenny did not represent a large capital.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got sixpence,&rsquo; he said; 
&lsquo;that&rsquo;ll buy milk for her.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll manage 
quite well, Floss.&nbsp; When mother goes out with her 
market-basket, we&rsquo;ll slip downstairs with Dickory, and well
take her away, and we&rsquo;ll hide her somewhere.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
28</span>She shan&rsquo;t go to no workhouse, the darling 
pet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, that she shan&rsquo;t, the dear!&rsquo; said 
Flossy.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely plan, Peter, and 
I&rsquo;ll just go and watch on the top of the stairs for mother 
to go out with the old market-basket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d better take a bag with us,&rsquo; said 
Peter.&nbsp; &lsquo;The bag will come in very handy; it will hold
baby&rsquo;s milk when we buy it, and some bread for you and me; 
for we may have to walk a long way before we find a nice 
hiding-place for Dickory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Children seldom take long in carrying out their resolutions, 
and Mrs Franklin, puzzled and anxious, and with no real intention
of sending the poor baby to the workhouse, had not long turned 
the corner of the street before the hall door of the rambling old
house was eagerly and nervously opened, and a funny little <!-- 
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
29</span>quartette issued forth.&nbsp; Dickory did not often get 
the air, and she enjoyed herself very much, sitting well up in 
Peter&rsquo;s arms, and wrapped up, head and all, in an old 
tartan shawl.&nbsp; Flossy, holding the bag, walked by her 
brother&rsquo;s side, and Snip-snap behaved in his usual erratic 
fashion, now running before, now lingering behind, now stopping 
to exchange a greeting with a fellow-dog, or to sniff with 
watering jaws and wistful eyes at a butcher&rsquo;s shop, but 
always returning faithfully to his charge, and always raising an 
inquiring face to see if Dickory was quite comfortable.&nbsp; She
was thoroughly so, and when she crowed, and laughed, and 
chuckled, Flossy wondered they had never thought of taking her 
out before.&nbsp; The sun was shining and the day was bright and 
warm, with the promise of spring in it, and the two children were
highly delighted with their <!-- page 30--><a 
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>scheme, and 
not a bit afraid of the result.&nbsp; The only thing which had at
all alarmed them was the fear that Mrs Franklin or Martha might 
find out their little plan before they had time to carry it into 
effect.</p>
<p>Having succeeded in getting quite away with the baby, they 
considered their difficulties at an end.&nbsp; Peter was old 
enough to know that a crooked halfpenny did not mean much, 
considered as a provision for three human beings and a dog; but 
he was still sufficiently young to have perfect confidence in the
capabilities of sixpence for meeting the demands of the 
hour.&nbsp; As they walked along, Flossy, Dickory, and Snip-snap 
were all very happy, and Peter too was happy, although his arms 
ached sadly.&nbsp; But, alas! the paths of the poor little 
adventurers were not to be without thorns.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>The time was April, and an April shower first damped the
ardour of the travellers&mdash;the poor baby&rsquo;s shawl was 
wet through, and she began to cry pitifully with hunger and want 
of sleep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must want her milk,&rsquo; said Peter; 
&lsquo;there, Dickory, there&rsquo;s a darling, now go to sleep 
like the dear baby you are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know, Peter, she won&rsquo;t go to sleep without 
her milk,&rsquo; said Flossy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll run across 
to that milk-shop and buy some.&nbsp; How much milk shall I get, 
Peter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth,&rsquo; said Peter; &lsquo;you 
get a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth, Flossy, and we&rsquo;ll sit down on 
the step of this empty house and feed the baby, and eat up our 
crusts ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A bottle to hold the milk was to be found in Flossy&rsquo;s 
bag, and accordingly in a short time Dickory had a meal; not 
quite what she was accustomed to, but sufficient to soothe her 
off into a slumber in which she forgot the discomfort <!-- page 
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of 
her damp clothes and all her other baby tribulations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flossy,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;we have gone a long 
way from home now, and baby is asleep and resting nicely on my 
knee; my arm won&rsquo;t ache a bit when she wakes, and 
I&rsquo;ll be able to carry her a splendid long way.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;ll have to think of making up our plans, 
Floss&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to find some place where we can all 
sleep comfortably to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got sixpence,&rsquo; said Flossy, 
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s lots and lots of money; but the night is a 
long way off, Peter, and I&rsquo;m so hungry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
eaten up all the crusts that you and Snip-snap left for me, but 
I&rsquo;m still as hungry as possible.&nbsp; Mightn&rsquo;t I 
spend a halfpenny or so of our sixpence in getting a good dinner 
for you and me and Snip-snap?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter put his hand to his brow, and began to reflect.</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
33</span>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Floss,&rsquo; he said, 
&lsquo;for I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t understand 
marketing&mdash;it&rsquo;s best for me to go, for I&rsquo;m quite
old, and I know the way mother talks to the baker&rsquo;s man and
the milkman when they come to the door.&nbsp; I must be sharp 
with them, Floss; that&rsquo;s what I must be, and I don&rsquo;t 
think you could be; so you had better hold the baby while I fetch
our dinner.&nbsp; Oh dear, what a good thing it is I have got 
sixpence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The baby, being very sound asleep, was transferred to 
Flossy&rsquo;s arms without waking, Snip-snap was left in charge 
of the two, and Peter, who knew very little more of London and 
London life than his little sister, started off manfully to the 
eating-house round the corner.&nbsp; He had gone away with a 
bright face, but he returned in a very short time with one 
singularly depressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit of stale bread for each of <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>us,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I had to give two 
halfpennies for that.&nbsp; I did see such a nice piece of beef 
and of pudding, and I ordered some for you and me and Snip-snap, 
but the woman said all that much would cost three sixpences, so 
then I had to say I wouldn&rsquo;t have it; and I took the stale 
bread, and she was very cross.&nbsp; O Floss, I hope I&rsquo;m 
right about sixpence; I hope it will buy a bed for baby, and milk
and food for us all, for I&rsquo;m thinking we had much better 
none of us go back to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, we won&rsquo;t go back,&rsquo; said 
Flossie.&nbsp; &lsquo;The stale bread&rsquo;s &rsquo;licious, and
I&rsquo;m so hungry.&nbsp; O Peter, do look!&nbsp; Dickory is 
stretching herself, and rubbing her little fat hands into her 
eyes; and I know she&rsquo;s going to wake, and I&rsquo;m afraid 
she&rsquo;ll cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give her to me,&rsquo; said Peter, with the air of a 
practised nurse.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hold her, <!-- page 
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and 
you can feed me while I&rsquo;m doing so, Flossy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all Peter&rsquo;s efforts, notwithstanding
his singing, and even shouting, for the baby&rsquo;s benefit, 
notwithstanding the admiring cheers of a little street mob that 
collected round him, the baby cried, not a loud cry, but a weak, 
broken-hearted wail.&nbsp; The fact was, the indifferent milk 
Flossy had fed her with had made her ill, and her little frame 
was already sadly chilled by the damp shawl which she wore about 
her.&nbsp; Poor Dickory scarcely ever got any air or exercise, 
and in consequence was very susceptible to cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is sneezing,&rsquo; said Flossy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh 
the poor, poor darling!&nbsp; Peter, I think we&rsquo;d better 
see about our night&rsquo;s lodging soon; it doesn&rsquo;t agree 
with Dickory to keep her out so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go at once,&rsquo; said Peter, rising <!-- 
page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
36</span>to his feet.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s another black 
cloud coming up, and there&rsquo;ll be a shower again before 
long.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get a nice room for us four, and then 
we&rsquo;ll be as happy as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the little party again moved forward, and whenever
Peter or Flossy saw a card up in a window they stopped and rang 
the house-bell, and inquired for lodgings for themselves and 
their baby.&nbsp; Of course, they were repulsed in all kinds of 
ways&mdash;some people merely laughing, and shutting the door in 
their faces; some scolding them, and calling them tiresome, 
impertinent little brats; and some even threatening to tell the 
police about them; but no one ever hinted at the possibility of 
taking them in.&nbsp; Presently they left the more respectable 
streets, and wandered into very poor quarters.&nbsp; Here, 
doubtless, they could have found accommodation were they <!-- 
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>able to pay for it, but everybody laughed at 
Peter&rsquo;s pennies, and no one dreamt of offering them a 
shelter.&nbsp; Then the rain which had threatened came down, and 
baby was again wet through, and now she looked ill, as well as 
fretful, and refused some fresh milk which Flossy bought for 
her.&nbsp; She was not the least like the bright little Dickory 
who used to laugh and show her dimples in the old attic-nursery 
at home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said Peter, &lsquo;what are we to 
do?&nbsp; &rsquo;T will be night soon, and we haven&rsquo;t found
no hiding-place for Dickory, and no one will take us 
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baby is not at all well, either,&rsquo; said Flossy; 
&lsquo;her head is quite hot, like fire, when I touch 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are we to do?&rsquo; asked Peter.&nbsp; &lsquo;We 
can&rsquo;t get home, but it seems to me, Floss, that this is 
worse for poor Dickory than the workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; said Flossy 
suddenly, raising her bright half-humorous face to Peter&rsquo;s,
&lsquo;let&rsquo;s take baby to the lady what cried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady who cried?&rsquo; repeated Peter.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about her, Floss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Peter, you do know; it was that day our Uncle David 
took us a long walk, and we went to the cemetery with him, you 
know, the place with the flowers and the trees, and where they 
put the pretty little children when they die&mdash;there was a 
little baby being put there, and there was a lady crying very, 
very bitter.&nbsp; I never saw no one cry so dreadful bitter as 
that lady, and they said she was putting her baby in the 
ground.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure she must want another baby, and I 
think perhaps it would be right for us to give her 
Dickory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s face became very sad.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
39</span>Dickory away.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite dreadfully fond of 
her; it seems to me she makes a lot of difference in the house, 
and you know, Floss, it used to be very dull before she 
came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Flossy, &lsquo;I love her more than 
anything; she&rsquo;s a dear baby, and I never find the days long
when I&rsquo;m playing with her and talking to her: but you see, 
Peter, she&rsquo;s not to be kept at home; she&rsquo;s to go to 
the workhouse to-morrow morning, unless we can find a nice 
hiding-place for her.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t find a hiding-place, 
Peter, for though you are a rich boy and have got a lot of 
pennies, yet you haven&rsquo;t enough for us to get a room for 
ourselves and Dickory, and the night air don&rsquo;t agree with 
her&mdash;oh, there, she&rsquo;s sneezing again&mdash;bless her, 
the pet!&nbsp; Peter, I hope you always say &ldquo;bless 
her!&rdquo; when Dickory sneezes.&nbsp; Martha says it 
isn&rsquo;t lucky if you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; O Peter, I do <!-- 
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
40</span>think if we must part with the baby it would be better 
to give her to the lady who cried than to send her to the 
workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we don&rsquo;t know where the lady lives,&rsquo; 
said Peter.&nbsp; &lsquo;We might do it if we knew where the lady
lived; but we can&rsquo;t, however much we wish to, if we 
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do know,&rsquo; answered Flossy, &lsquo;I know 
quite well, &lsquo;cause last week I saw the lady.&nbsp; I was 
out with mother, and mother went to the greengrocer&rsquo;s, and 
while she was there the lady comed in.&nbsp; She was all in 
black, and I am sure she had been crying a lot, for she looked so
sad; and I knew it was her.&nbsp; Afterwards mother and I walked 
behind her as she went home, and she turned into a great big 
house in the square near us.&nbsp; You know the square, Peter, 
the square that begins with a big B; Bev--- something, I 
can&rsquo;t say it all.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
41</span>&lsquo;Bevington Square,&rsquo; said Peter, in a gloomy 
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, that was it, and 10 was the number of the 
house.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t forget the number &rsquo;cause I asked
mother, and she said it was 10.&nbsp; O Peter, that&rsquo;s where
our lady lives, and I do think it would be better to give her 
Dickory.&nbsp; There, Peter, bless her! she&rsquo;s sneezing 
again.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we had better take her to the 
lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; answered Peter, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be 
a termagant again when she&rsquo;s gone; see if I 
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get up an awful racking cough at 
night, and I&rsquo;ll worry that nasty Mr Martin much more than 
Dickory has worried him, see if I don&rsquo;t; and I&rsquo;ll 
sing on the stairs, and I&rsquo;ll whistle awful loud, and 
I&rsquo;ll buy a Jew&rsquo;s-harp with one of my pennies.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll turn into a horrid boy! but I suppose you are right 
about Dickory, Flossy.&nbsp; Here, let&rsquo;s go back as fast as
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>we can to that house you were so &rsquo;cute as to take 
the number of.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m mis&rsquo;rible, and I mean to be 
mis&rsquo;rible, so don&rsquo;t you expect nothing cheerful from 
me, Flossy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, Peter,&rsquo; said Flossy meekly.</p>
<p>And then the little party, slowly and painfully, for Flossy 
was very, very tired, and poor Peter&rsquo;s arms ached 
fearfully, retraced their steps.&nbsp; The baby had ceased crying
and was asleep, and after about two hours&rsquo; patient walking 
and asking their way, the children found themselves in Bevington 
Square.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d better go up first to the door,&rsquo; said 
Flossy, &lsquo;and ask her if she&rsquo;d like a baby.&nbsp; You 
might stand round there, Peter, and you might keep Snip-snap with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t press her about it,&rsquo; said 
Peter; &lsquo;if she don&rsquo;t seem quite delighted we 
won&rsquo;t give up Dickory on no account; and kiss her before 
you go, Flossy, for <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>of course the lady will take her; and
in a few minutes she won&rsquo;t be our Dickory no 
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter unfastened a corner of the old tartan shawl, and Flossy 
imprinted a grave kiss on the baby&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp; Then, 
with great solemnity, and with the air of one engaged on an 
important mission, she went up the steps of the great house and 
rang the bell.&nbsp; Flossy was an attractive little child, her 
hair was really beautiful, and she had a very wistful and taking 
manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please,&rsquo; she said now to the tall, powdered 
footman, &lsquo;I know the lady what cried is here; please can I 
see her?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve brought her a little baby, and I want 
to see her about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Flossy did not look quite like a common child, and her face 
wore a very sweet expression when she spoke of the baby; 
nevertheless the footman only stared <!-- page 44--><a 
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>at her, and 
would have certainly shut the door in her face, had not the lady 
of the house at that moment come into the hall.&nbsp; Flossy saw 
her, and quick as thought she darted past the servant and up to 
the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please, lady,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve often 
thought of you, and I&rsquo;m so very sorry for you.&nbsp; 
Please, I&rsquo;ve brought you another little baby instead of the
one you put into the ground in the pretty place where the flowers
and trees are.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a dear little baby, and when you
have her you won&rsquo;t cry no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Flossy&rsquo;s voice was very earnest, and her eyes looking up
full into the lady&rsquo;s face were full of the most intense 
sympathy.&nbsp; Those pretty eyes of hers were too much for the 
poor bereaved mother: she put her handkerchief to her own eyes, 
and there and then burst into fits of fresh weeping.</p>
<p><!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>&lsquo;Come away, little girl, at once,&rsquo; said the 
indignant footman; but the lady put out one of her hands and took
Flossy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave the child with me,&rsquo; she said to the 
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be better in a moment, little 
girl,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;and then you shall tell me 
what you mean; but you have upset me talking about babies: it is 
not long since I buried my child, my only child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw you,&rsquo; said Flossy, nodding her bright 
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was in the cemetery and I saw you.&nbsp; Oh,
didn&rsquo;t you cry bitter! but you needn&rsquo;t cry no more 
now, for God has sent you another little baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my little girl,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;He has
not.&nbsp; I have asked Him, but it is not His will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guessed you&rsquo;d want another baby,&rsquo; said 
Flossy.&nbsp; &lsquo;I knew quite well you would, and she&rsquo;s
waiting for you round the corner with Peter and Snip-snap.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>You put on your bonnet and come and look at her; 
she&rsquo;s a real beauty; she&rsquo;s got a dimple, and her name
is Dickory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rsquo; said the lady in an excited 
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the very strangest thing I ever 
heard.&nbsp; A child coming to me like that.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll 
slip out, little girl.&nbsp; James need not open the door for 
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Flossy wondered who James was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me your hand, little girl,&rsquo; continued the 
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And take me to the baby; I&rsquo;ll look at 
her anyhow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Peter was standing in a very sulky attitude at the corner 
where the railings were.&nbsp; In his heart of hearts he was 
extremely anxious that Flossy&rsquo;s mission should fail.&nbsp; 
It seemed to him that every bit of the niceness, all the interest
would go out of his life if he hadn&rsquo;t Dickory.&nbsp; In 
some ways he considered that Dickory was more to him than she was
to Flossy.&nbsp; He wondered how Flossy could even talk <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>of 
parting with her.&nbsp; He hoped sincerely she would fail in 
winning the lady&rsquo;s pity.</p>
<p>But no, there they were both coming to meet him, the tall lady
in deep black, and little eager wistful Flossy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the lady what cried,&rsquo; she said to 
Peter.&nbsp; &lsquo;She have come out to see our baby.&nbsp; Show
her our baby, Peter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In solemn gloomy silence Peter unfolded a morsel of the tartan
shawl which covered the baby&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me have her in my arms, please,&rsquo; said the 
lady.</p>
<p>She took the baby tenderly, peeped once again at its small wee
face, felt a sudden glow coming back into empty arms and more 
empty heart, and then turned again to the children.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p47b.jpg">
<img alt="She took the baby tenderly" src="images/p47s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I must be mad to do such a thing,&rsquo; she 
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two little waifs in the street come and offer 
me a baby, and I don&rsquo;t refuse it!&nbsp; There, baby,&rsquo;
for Dickory <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>began to cry again, &lsquo;there, 
baby&mdash;hush, sweet&mdash;hush, dear little baby, 
hush.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This lady&rsquo;s voice had quite a new tone for Dickory, a 
sweeter tone even than Peter&rsquo;s or Flossy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She
stopped crying at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our baby takes to you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Flossy,
in a voice of thrilling interest.</p>
<p>Peter, very pale, and still silent, drew a step nearer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, children,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;I have 
made up my mind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take this baby home for the 
night.&nbsp; My husband will think me mad&mdash;anyone in their 
senses would think me mad, but I&rsquo;m nearly wild with 
mother-hunger, and that little mite there,&rsquo; pointing to 
Flossy, &lsquo;guessed it, and she brought me the baby, and I say
God bless her for it, whether she&rsquo;s a ragamuffin or 
not.&nbsp; Yes, I have made up my mind.&nbsp; I shall take the 
baby home for to-night at least.&nbsp; In the <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>morning I 
shall make inquiries, but for to-night the baby is 
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half milk, half water in her bottle,&rsquo; said Peter 
in a very grave reproachful voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Half milk, half 
water, and a little sugar, and a pinch of salt, and Dickory likes
her feet kept werry warm.&nbsp; Come home, Flossy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And we are not ragamuffins, please lady,&rsquo; said 
Flossy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our name is Franklin, and we live in 24 
Montfiore Square.&nbsp; We lets lodgings, please lady, and it was
Mr Martin what turned so crusty about baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell your mother I will come and see her 
to-morrow,&rsquo; said the lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have a mother, 
I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, oh yes.&nbsp; She wanted to send the baby to the 
workhouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that will be necessary.&nbsp; My 
name is Ross.&nbsp; Tell your mother to expect me 
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
50</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>It is one thing to feel very angry about a baby, and another 
to wish that helpless little atom of humanity positive ill.&nbsp;
Mr Martin was an old bachelor, and even mothers could scarcely 
blame him for objecting to having his first sweet sleep disturbed
by the wailings of a child who was cutting its teeth.&nbsp; Mr 
Martin meant what he said when he proposed to change 
lodgings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some one else can have my present room,&rsquo; he 
remarked.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be preposterous to send that 
infant to the workhouse.&nbsp; A less sensitive person than I am 
can occupy my present parlour and bedroom; comfortable rooms, 
too.&rsquo;&nbsp; He sighed as he went out.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>He was a man who disliked change, and he felt that he 
had been treated badly.&nbsp; Mrs Franklin had no right to bring 
a wailing niece of a few weeks old into the house where he lived,
and it was unfair and inconsiderate.&nbsp; Well, there was no 
help for it; the baby had come and could not be displaced, and 
now there was nothing for it but for him to engage the rooms 
opposite, which were certainly not nearly so nice, nor so much to
his taste.&nbsp; He had promised Mrs Franklin that he would give 
her a short time to consider, but in his heart of hearts he was 
quite certain that he must take the detested step.</p>
<p>Mr Martin was a retired merchant.&nbsp; He had plenty of 
money, and his working days were over.&nbsp; He generally went to
his club in the morning, and he always returned about one 
o&rsquo;clock in the day to a comfortable mid-day repast.&nbsp; 
Always <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>sharp as the clock struck one, Martha
placed upon Mr Martin&rsquo;s board a smoking steak done to 
perfection.&nbsp; He had the same lunch every day&mdash;he drank 
a glass of ale with his steak.&nbsp; He required this simple meal
to be served with regularity.&nbsp; He insisted that his steak 
should always be tender and properly cooked&mdash;that was 
all&mdash;he would not have stayed a week in any lodgings where 
the landlady could not provide him with his steak and glass of 
beer as he liked them, sharp at one o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>To-day he returned as usual, sighing a little as he entered 
the square.</p>
<p>What a troublesome baby that was!&nbsp; What a nuisance it 
would be to move!&nbsp; He doubted very much if the people 
opposite knew how to cook steak.&nbsp; He let himself into the 
house with his latchkey, hung up his coat and hat in the 
hall&mdash;he was a most methodical old gentleman&mdash;<!-- page
53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and 
turned into his parlour.&nbsp; He expected the usual scene to 
meet his eyes, the fire burning brightly, a snowy cloth on the 
table, and Martha in the act of placing an appetising covered 
dish on the board.&nbsp; This homely and domestic scene, however,
was not destined to meet him to-day.&nbsp; The fire in the grate 
was out, there were no preparations for lunch on the table, and 
taking up the greater part of the light from one of the windows 
might have been seen the portly form of Mrs Potts.</p>
<p>Mrs Potts was the drawing-room lodger, and Mr Martin both 
dreaded and detested her.&nbsp; He shrank back a step or 
two.&nbsp; What was she doing in his room?&nbsp; The absence of 
lunch was bad enough, but this unexpected and undesired company 
was insult on injury.</p>
<p>Mr Martin bowed, cleared his throat, and prepared to make an 
elaborate <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>speech.&nbsp; Mrs Potts interrupted 
him fiercely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good sir, this is no time for ceremony&mdash;the 
wailing infant up-stairs and the two children of the house have 
been stolen since the morning.&nbsp; Mrs Franklin is almost out 
of her mind with grief, and suspicion points to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, madam, what <i>do</i> you mean?&rsquo; 
said poor Mr Martin in a limp voice.&nbsp; He sank down on the 
nearest chair, spreading out his hands on his knees.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
children stolen!&nbsp; Who stole them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps <i>you</i> can answer that question.&nbsp; Who 
was it made such an indecent fuss this morning because a poor 
fatherless and motherless babe cried?&nbsp; Who threatened to 
leave if that same poor babe wasn&rsquo;t sent to the 
workhouse?&nbsp; Answer me that, Mr Martin, and then tell me <!--
page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
55</span>if you know nothing of the fate of the hapless 
innocents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Martin looked cautiously round at the door, which was 
slightly ajar.&nbsp; He got up softly and shut it.&nbsp; Then he 
advanced gently across the room and came up close to Mrs 
Potts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Answer <i>me</i> this,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did
you like it, yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I like what?&nbsp; Good gracious, the man frightens
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you like the wailing sounds of the fatherless and 
motherless baby?&nbsp; You were nearer to it than I was.&nbsp; If
you heard it last night, and felt all the pity you now express, 
you had a good opportunity of putting it to the test by going 
up-stairs and lulling the unfortunate babe to rest.&nbsp; A 
woman&rsquo;s mission, too, I have always understood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Potts turned scarlet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I!&nbsp; I do what you describe!&rsquo; she <!-- page 
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
56</span>said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You forget yourself, Mr 
Martin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fail to see that I do, Mrs Potts.&nbsp; It strikes me
that it is rather the other way.&nbsp; Perhaps you will do me the
kindness to let me have my room in peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Potts made a sweeping curtsey and vanished, and Mr Martin 
stood for some time in his deserted parlour feeling far more 
uncomfortable than he liked to confess.&nbsp; He was methodical 
and fussy, but he was by no means an ill-natured man.&nbsp; He 
thought Mrs Potts most impertinent, but her news distressed 
him.&nbsp; After reflecting for a few moments, he went across to 
the fireplace, and pulled his bell sharply.&nbsp; After a short 
pause the kitchen slavey answered his summons: her eyes were red 
with weeping, and her nose very smutty.&nbsp; Mr Martin hated 
dirty servants.&nbsp; He turned his back to her as he spoke.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span>&lsquo;Jane, is your mistress in?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Please sir, we&rsquo;re all distraught 
with grief.&nbsp; You have heard of 
the&mdash;the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard of the calamity, through Mrs Potts.&nbsp; 
Can I speak to your mistress?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll inquire, please sir.&nbsp; Missus is having 
her fourth hysteric fit just now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I beg&rsquo;&mdash;Mr Martin&rsquo;s face grew 
quite white&mdash;&lsquo;I beg you won&rsquo;t disturb her until 
she is equal to seeing me.&rsquo;&nbsp; (&lsquo;How awful if the 
fifth comes on in this room,&rsquo; he mentally thought.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to tell her not to disturb 
herself.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>But Jane had vanished.</p>
<p>In about a quarter of an hour Mrs Franklin appeared.&nbsp; She
was pale, but her grief was temperate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am in very great 
distress.&nbsp; The children, Peter and Flossy, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>have 
evidently run away with that poor baby.&nbsp; Flossy was in the 
room when you spoke to me this morning, Mr Martin, and she must 
have taken fright at your words.&nbsp; The children took the 
opportunity to leave the house when I was out marketing.&nbsp; 
Your steak is being cooked, Mr Martin.&nbsp; I must apologise for
the delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Madam, I beg you won&rsquo;t mention it.&nbsp; I am 
deeply grieved that this should have happened, and that I am the 
cause.&nbsp; I am more grieved than I can possibly express.&nbsp;
I would rather lie awake all night listening to those yells of 
that miserable infant than that this&mdash;this&mdash;should have
happened.&nbsp; The alarm, the upsetting of the household 
routine, the inroad into my sanctum of that awful 
female&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;of your drawing-room 
lodger&mdash;and last but not least, the danger to three innocent
human creatures.&nbsp; I <!-- page 59--><a 
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>am 
overpowered with remorse at the sorry part I have played 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, Mr Martin.&nbsp; I always said 
there&rsquo;d be trouble when the baby was brought.&nbsp; It 
can&rsquo;t be helped now.&nbsp; Of course we must keep it, but 
I&rsquo;m sorry to lose a valuable and considerate lodger like 
yourself, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; Are any steps being taken to recover 
the children?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband has gone to the nearest police-station, 
sir.&nbsp; Poor mites, and Flossy&rsquo;s not so strong in her 
chest.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re safe to be back by to-night, Mr 
Martin.&nbsp; And perhaps you&rsquo;d like some one to help you 
with your packing, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll consider it,&rsquo; said Mr
Martin.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m not such a young 
man as I was, Mrs Franklin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure, sir.&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;re none 
of us that, are we?&nbsp; I should take you, <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>sir, begging 
your pardon, to be but a very little way on the wrong side of 
forty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Martin chuckled, and then grew grave.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the wrong side of sixty,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Now, now, no humbugging, I beg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, about the packing.&nbsp; My head is all in a
muddle, it is true, but any help that I can 
give&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you say to a baize door?&rsquo; replied Mr 
Martin, rather irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a very thick curtain inside my room door?&nbsp; It 
is true I have heard it remarked that the wails of an infant when
teething will penetrate through any obstacles.&nbsp; Still, a 
baize door inside your nursery door, and thick curtains inside 
mine would soften the disturbance&mdash;yes, would soften 
it.&nbsp; I was going to say that I would provide 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>&lsquo;Then you will stay after all, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, do you agree with me? do you think my plan 
will make matters easier?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t they just!&rsquo; said Mrs Franklin, 
tears now brimming over in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a 
good man, Mr Martin, and God will bless you, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; said Flossy, when at last she got home, 
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s all right about Dickory.&nbsp; We took her to 
the lady what cried.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Franklin had Flossy in her arms when she made this 
remark.&nbsp; Now she pressed her close with one arm, and with 
the other drew Peter to her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me the whole story, my darlings,&rsquo; she 
said.</p>
<p>Which they did, Mr Martin himself coming into the kitchen and 
listening to them.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
62</span>&lsquo;Why, I know Mrs Ross,&rsquo; he said 
suddenly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid chance for the 
infant, a splendid chance.&nbsp; Miles better than a baize door 
and thick curtains.&nbsp; Only you won&rsquo;t forget that I made
you the offer, Mrs Franklin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m never likely to forget 
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid chance,&rsquo; repeated Mr 
Martin.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Rosses are wealthy, and she&rsquo;s just
that eccentric, generous, impulsive creature who would be sure to
take to a child brought to her so.&nbsp; I consider you a very 
clever little girl, Flossy Franklin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Peter put his head down upon the table, and began to cry, 
for his heart was very sore for Dickory.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>However, in the end even Peter was comforted.&nbsp; When next 
the children saw Dickory she was beautifully dressed, she <!-- 
page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>had a grand nurse all to herself, and two splendid 
nurseries entirely at her own disposal.&nbsp; The grand nurse 
said that she was a most refined baby, that she must have very 
good blood in her veins, for she had such a &lsquo;haristocratic 
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grand nurse felt rather inclined to look down upon Peter 
and Flossy Franklin, but not so Dickory herself.&nbsp; Out went 
her baby arms, dimples came into her baby face, and with a crow 
of rapture she nestled up into Peter&rsquo;s embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, but she&rsquo;s a &rsquo;cute young 
&rsquo;un,&rsquo; he said with his slow smile.</p>
<p>And somehow after that he was comforted.&nbsp; He felt that it
would have been wrong of him to stand in the way of such a 
brilliant lot for his darling.</p>
<p>Flossy and he went back to the attic, which was no longer at 
all a cheerful apartment.&nbsp; They did not, however, spend <!--
page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
64</span>so much of their time there as formerly, for Mr Martin 
had taken a fancy to the children, and they often now spent their
evenings with him.</p>
<p>On these occasions he was often seen to regard them both with 
a puzzled look on his somewhat testy but still kind-hearted 
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>The</i> cleverest little girl in the world,&rsquo; 
he would say, signifying Flossy by a motion of his hand.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;For it is my private belief that even curtains and a baize
door would not have softened the piercing sound.&nbsp; Yes, 
Flossy got me out of my dilemma in a wonderful way.&rsquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
